<h1> AirBnB Clone Project </h1>
This repository contains the curriculum and project details for the Software Engineering Foundations course. The primary focus is on building an AirBnB clone in Python, introducing fundamental concepts and skills essential for web application development.

<h1> Project Overview </h1>
<h2> AirBnB Clone - The Console </h2>

- Weight: 5
- By: Guillaume
- Start Date: Mar 4, 2024 6:00 AM
- End Date: Mar 11, 2024 6:00 AM
- Checker Release: Mar 9, 2024 12:00 PM
- Team: Joseph Nchimunya, Mucheru Maina
- Concepts Covered
- Python packages
- AirBnB clone
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

<h2> Background Context </h2>
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! Before diving in, please read the AirBnB concept page. This project's first step involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, setting the foundation for subsequent tasks like HTML/CSS templating, database storage, and API integration.

<h2> Learning Objectives </h2>
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Create a Python package
- Develop a command interpreter using the cmd module
- Implement Unit testing in a large project
- Serialize and deserialize a Class
- Read and write a JSON file
- Manage datetime in Python
- Understand UUIDs and their applications
- Utilize *args and **kwargs
- Handle named arguments in a function

<h2> Requirements </h2>
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
Files end with a new line
The first line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3
Mandatory README.md file at the root
Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All files must be executable
File length will be tested using wc
All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
Python Unit Tests
Test files should end with a new line
Test files inside a folder named "tests"
Unittest module should be used
Test files must start with "test_"
Test file organization should mirror the project structure
All tests should be executed by using python3 -m unittest discover tests
Execution

Your shell should work both in interactive and non-interactive modes. Example:

Interactive mode:

```bash
Copy code
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
Non-interactive mode:

```bash
Copy code
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$```

All tests should pass in non-interactive mode:

```bash
Copy code
$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
```

Remember, collaboration is encouraged on test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Note: Each group should maintain a single project repository to avoid score penalties.
